Transitioning to Part 3, the scope expands from an individual's view to an organizational overview, showcasing the administrative backend of the system. Here, users with HR, Manager, or Coordinator roles log in to a fundamentally different dashboard. Instead of a form for creating claims, they are presented with a queue or list of all claims submitted by various lecturers, filterable by status (such as "Pending," "Approved," or "Rejected"). This shift moves the focus from data creation to data oversight and workflow management.

The core interactive element in Part 3 is the claim review and authorization process. Whereas the Lecturer's role ended at submission, the administrator's primary function begins there. The demonstration shows the ability to select a "Pending" claim, review the details submitted by the Lecturer—including the hours worked, calculated amount, and any attached documents—and then execute a decisive action: either approving the claim for payment or rejecting it with a mandatory reason for transparency and record-keeping.

Ultimately, Part 3 highlights the completion of the business process cycle that was initiated in Part 2. It illustrates how the application enforces organizational policy and financial control, ensuring that every claim is vetted and authorized before being finalized. This dual perspective fully showcases the system's role-based access control, demonstrating a secure and efficient end-to-end process for claim management, from initial employee submission to final administrative approval.
